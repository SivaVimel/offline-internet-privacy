<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Offline Internet</strong> ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the application.</p>

<p>By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. No Account Required</h2>
<p>The App does not require registration or account creation. You can use all features without signing up or providing personal details.</p>

<h2>2. Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p>The developer of the App does not collect or store personal information. However, third-party services integrated into the App (such as advertising providers) may automatically process limited technical identifiers required for their operation.</p>

<p>The developer does not collect or store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Photos or files</li>
<li>Precise location data</li>
</ul>

<p>Your searches and activities remain on your device.</p>

<h2>3. Search Queries</h2>
<p>Search queries entered inside Offline Internet are processed locally on your device when using offline mode. The developer does not receive, store, or transmit your queries.</p>

<h2>4. Internet Access & Web Browsing</h2>
<p>When internet mode is used, the App opens web pages through an in-app browser (WebView). External websites are responsible for their own content and privacy practices.</p>

<p>The App itself does not monitor, record, or store the websites you visit.</p>

<p>When online search is used, requests are sent directly from your device to external search providers and websites. These requests are not routed through or stored by the developer.</p>

<h2>5. Offline Knowledge Data</h2>
<p>The App allows optional downloading of publicly available open knowledge datasets (for example, encyclopedia content). These files are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to the developer.</p>

<h2>6. Advertising</h2>
<p>The App displays advertisements provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may automatically collect limited technical data to provide ads, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device type</li>
<li>Approximate location (non-precise)</li>
<li>Advertising ID</li>
<li>App interaction events</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is collected and processed by Google, not by the App developer.</p>

</p>

<h2>6A. Advertising Identifier</h2>
<p>To support advertising, third-party services such as Google AdMob may access a device identifier known as the <strong>Advertising ID</strong>.</p>

<p>This identifier may be used by the advertising provider to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display advertisements</li>
<li>Limit repetitive ads</li>
<li>Measure ad performance</li>
<li>Prevent invalid activity and fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>The developer of Offline Internet does not access, store, or control the Advertising ID.</p>

<p>Users can reset or disable the Advertising ID at any time from their Android device settings:</p>
<p><strong>Settings → Privacy → Ads → Delete advertising ID</strong></p>

<h2>7. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All generated content, cached information, and downloaded datasets remain stored locally on your device. The developer has no access to this data.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age. The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>Because the App does not store personal information on external servers, your data primarily remains on your device.</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App may use third-party services necessary for functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Play Services</li>
<li>Google AdMob</li>
<li>External websites accessed through the in-app browser</li>
</ul>

<p>These services have their own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect feature or policy changes. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

<h2>12. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact:</p>

Developer: Siva Vimel Rajhen<br>
Email: sivavimelrajhen@gmail.com
</p>

<h2>13. Data Security and Transmission</h2>
<p>All communications performed by third-party services (such as advertising providers or external websites) use industry-standard encrypted connections (HTTPS). The application itself does not transmit personal data to the developer's servers.</p>
