<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Offline Internet</strong> ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the application.</p>

<p>By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. No Account Required</h2>
<p>The App does not require registration or account creation. You can use all features without signing up or providing personal details.</p>

<h2>2. Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not collect, store, or share personal information</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Photos or files</li>
<li>Location data</li>
</ul>

<p>Your searches and activities remain on your device.</p>

<h2>3. Search Queries</h2>
<p>Search queries entered inside Offline Internet are processed locally on your device when using offline mode. The developer does not receive, store, or transmit your queries.</p>

<h2>4. Internet Access & Web Browsing</h2>
<p>When internet mode is used, the App opens web pages through an in-app browser (WebView). External websites are responsible for their own content and privacy practices.</p>

<p>The App itself does not monitor, record, or store the websites you visit.</p>

<h2>5. Offline Knowledge Data</h2>
<p>The App allows optional downloading of publicly available open knowledge datasets (for example, encyclopedia content). These files are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to the developer.</p>

<h2>6. Advertising</h2>
<p>The App displays advertisements provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may automatically collect limited technical data to provide ads, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device type</li>
<li>Approximate location (non-precise)</li>
<li>Advertising ID</li>
<li>App interaction events</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is collected by Google, not by the App developer.</p>

</p>

<h2>7. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All generated content, cached information, and downloaded datasets remain stored locally on your device. The developer has no access to this data.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age. The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>Because the App does not store personal information on external servers, your data primarily remains on your device.</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App may use third-party services necessary for functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Play Services</li>
<li>Google AdMob</li>
<li>External websites accessed through the in-app browser</li>
</ul>

<p>These services have their own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect feature or policy changes. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

<h2>12. Contact</h2>
